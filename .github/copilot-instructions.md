This is a React.js single-page application for the Rajalakshmi Engineering College Entrepreneurship Development Cell (E-Cell).

## Project Guidelines

- **Theme**: EDC Logo color palette (Pure Black #000000, Pure White #FFFFFF, Pure Red #FF0000)
- **Logo**: Official EDC logo with arrow/chevron design and chart bars
- **Architecture**: Modular component-based structure with functional components and React Hooks
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion and React Awesome Reveal for extraordinary animations
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for scoped styling (.module.css files)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, especially for color contrast and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth animations

## Key Features

- Hero section with video integration and animated CTAs
- Scroll-triggered reveals for all major sections
- Interactive event cards and team member profiles
- Contact form with validation
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Dark theme optimizations (no shadows, lighter fills for depth)

## Component Structure

- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Logo, etc.)
- `src/sections/` - Layout-specific sections (HeroSection, AboutSection, etc.)
- `src/assets/` - Static assets (images, videos, fonts)
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/` - Helper functions

Always prioritize accessibility, performance, and the specified black/white/red theme in all code suggestions.
